This package contains a Java 1.0 - Java 9 Parser with AST generation and visitor support.

The AST records the source code structure.
You can analyze source code for any purpose.
It is possible to change the AST nodes or create new ones to modify the source code.

When you need not only the text from the source code but you also need type information,
you can use [the Java Symbol Solver project.](https://github.com/javaparser/javasymbolsolver)

## Dependency Management

The project binaries are available in Maven Central.  Just add the following to your maven configuration or tailor to your own dependency management system.

[Please refer to the Migration Guide when upgrading from 2.5.1](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/wiki/Migration-Guide)
```xml
<dependency>

    <artifactId>javaparser-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## How To Compile Sources

If you checked out the project from GitHub you can build the project with maven using:

```
mvn clean install
```

If you checkout the sources and want to view the project in an IDE, it is best to first generate some of the source files; otherwise you will get many compilation complaints in the IDE. (mvn clean install already does this for you.)

```
mvn javacc:javacc
```

## History

This parser is based on work by Sreenivasa Viswanadha and JÃºlio Vilmar Gesser. The original project, now inactive, was originally hosted at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/javaparser/) and supported only parsing Java 1.5.

The project now supports parsing Java 9 and aims to continue support for features in future versions of the Java language.

## Related projects

[JavaSymbolSolver](https://github.com/javaparser/javasymbolsolver) is a project from the same committers working on JavaParser.
You can use it to calculate the type of JavaParser expressions and connecting references with their declarations. 

From JavaParser other projects have been derived:

* [Walkmod](http://walkmod.com/): a tool to automatically correct violations of code conventions
* [jooby spec](http://jooby.org/doc/spec): analyze and exports [jooby routes](http://jooby.org) to [raml](http://raml.org) and [Swagger](http://swagger.io)
