## History

This parser is based on work by Sreenivasa Viswanadha and JÃºlio Vilmar Gesser. The original project, now inactive, was originally hosted at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/javaparser/) and supported only parsing Java 1.5.

The project now supports parsing Java 1.8 and aims to continue support for features in future versions of the Java language.
