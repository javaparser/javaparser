/**
 * When deciding into which scope pattern variables should be introduced, it is sometimes necessary to determine whether
 * a statement can complete normally {@see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.22}.
 * The JLS specifies that a statement can complete normally only if it is reachable and specifies rules for what it
 * means for a statement to be reachable, but that part can be ignored in JavaParser since having unreachable code
 * results in a compilation error and is thus not supported. This means that all of the rules are implemented with the
 * assumption that provided nodes are reachable.
 *
 * An example of where this is needed is for the following rule regarding pattern variables introduced by if-statements.
 * 6.3.2.2. if Statements {@see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.3.2.2}:
 *   The following rules apply to a statement if (e) S (ยง14.9.1):
 *     A pattern variable is introduced by if (e) S iff (i) it is introduced by e when false and (ii) S cannot complete
 *     normally.
 *
 * This means that in this example:
 * {@code
 *   if (!(x instanceof Foo f)) {
 *       return;
 *   }
 *   System.out.println(f);
 * }
 * f will be in scope for the println call since the block making up the then-block of the if statement (S in the rule
 * above) cannot complete normally (since the last statement, return, cannot complete normally).
 * But, in this example:
 * {@code
 *   if (!(x instanceof Foo f)) { }
 * }
 * f is not introduced by the if statement since the empty then-block can complete normally.
