Version 3.6.16
------------------
* BREAKING: some parts of the module syntax used `Type` where they should have used `Name`.
This is now fixed, but your code may need to be adapted if you are parsing modules.

* BETA: the below work on Java Symbol Solver is still ongoing.

Version 3.5.1
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/64?closed=1)
* BETA: the below work on Java Symbol Solver is still ongoing.

Version 3.5.0
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/63?closed=1)
* A functional visitor API has been added. See [PR 1195](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/pull/1195) for now.
* Build is working again on Windows thanks to Leonardo Herrera.
* The pretty printer now has an option to order imports, also thanks to Leonardo Herrera.
* Receiver parameters are now well-supported instead of being a hack. See [issue 1194](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/pull/1194) for a description.
* BETA: the below work on Java Symbol Solver is still ongoing.

Version 3.4.4
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/62?closed=1)
* BETA: the below work on Java Symbol Solver is still ongoing.

Version 3.4.3
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/61?closed=1)
* BETA: we're still doing work to integrate parts of [Java Symbol Solver](https://github.com/javaparser/javasymbolsolver) to simplify its API.
* `VisitorMap` is joined by `VisitorSet` and `VisitorList`, 
for when you want to store `Node`s in collection but don't want its default equals/hascode behaviour

Version 3.4.2
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/60?closed=1)
* BETA: we're doing work to integrate parts of [Java Symbol Solver](https://github.com/javaparser/javasymbolsolver) to simplify its API.
* JDK 9 will compile JavaParser now.
* [An official sample Maven setup](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser-maven-sample) was added.

Version 3.4.1
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/59?closed=1)
* Two visitors were added: `NoCommentEqualsVisitor` and `NoCommentHashCodeVisitor` - 
as the name implies you can use these to compare nodes without considering comments.
Thanks Ryan Beckett!
* `isSomeType()` methods have been added for many types that help avoid `instanceof`.
* `asSomeType()` methods have been added for many types that help avoid casting to that type.
* `ifSomeType()` methods have been added for many types, giving a nice functional way of doing if-is-type-then-cast-to-type-then-use.
* The `LexicalPreservingPrinter` had its API changed a little: setup and printing are now separate things,
so you don't have to drag an instance of `LexicalPreservingPrinter` through your code anymore.  
* `traverseScope` was added to all nodes with a scope, so you can travel through the scope without tripping over (non-)optionality.


Version 3.4.0
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/58?closed=1)
* BREAKING: We missed a Java 9 feature which is now on board: try with resources can now refer to a resource declared outside of the statement.
This means that the node type you get for those resources is now `Expression` instead of `VariableDeclarationExpr`.
For Java 8 and below you can simply cast it to `VariableDeclarationExpr` again.
See also the Javadoc for `TryStmt`.
* You can now inspect the AST by exporting it to XML, JSON, YAML, or a Graphviz's dot diagram, thanks to Ryan Beckett!
* `GenericVisitorWithDefaults` and `VoidVisitorWithDefaults` were added which function like empty visitors, 
but all the visit methods call a default method by default.
* Annotation support was cleaned up, adding some obscure locations where you can have annotations.
* `EnumDeclaration` regained its constructor builder methods. They were accidentally lost around 3.2.2.
* `ArrayType` now has an `origin` field which indicates in which position the array brackets were found.

Version 3.3.5
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/57?closed=1)

Version 3.3.4
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/56?closed=1)
* `SourceZip` has been added.
Use it to read source code from jars or zip files.
Thank you @ryan-beckett !
* JavaCC was upgraded to 7.0.2
* A new option for the pretty printer was added.
You can now wrap-and-column-align parameters of method calls.
Thank you @tarilabs !

Version 3.3.3
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/55?closed=1)
* Parsing a partial java file (like an expression or statement) no longer ignores trailing code.
* New memory saving option: turn off token list.

Version 3.3.2
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/54?closed=1)
* `VisitorMap` lets you override hashcode/equals for nodes when used as a key for a map.

Version 3.3.1
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/53?closed=1)
* The token list is now mutable - see methods on `JavaToken`.
This caused mild breakage - some fields have become `Optional`.

Version 3.3.0
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/52?closed=1)
* Breaking: `TryStmt::tryBlock` and `EnclosedExpr::inner` were optional for no good reason. Now they are required.
* You can now ask a `JavaToken` for its category, which is useful for examining the token list or doing syntax highlighting or so.
* `enum` and `strictfp` can now be used as identifiers on lower Java versions.

Version 3.2.12
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/51?closed=1)

Version 3.2.11
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/50?closed=1)
* We're up to date with the latest Java 9 module system again.

Version 3.2.10
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/49?closed=1)
* `Node.replace(old, new)` was added, including property-specific `X.replaceY(newY)` methods

Version 3.2.9
------------------
Scrapped due to release problem.

Version 3.2.8
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/48?closed=1)
* Added `isInnerClass()` that checks if a `ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration` is an inner class (note: this is different from a nested class!)
* @ryan-beckett contributed a huge [Eclipse setup guide](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/wiki/Eclipse-Project-Setup-Guide)

Version 3.2.7
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/47?closed=1)
* We now recover from some parse errors! [Here is an article](https://matozoid.github.io/2017/06/11/parse-error-recovery.html)

Version 3.2.6
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/46?closed=1)
* `EmptyMemberDeclaration` is gone! 
It was deprecated for a while because it it was in the AST, but doesn't have any meaning in a Java program. 
`EmptyStmt` was also deprecated, but that has been reverted. 
This node *does* have meaning.

Version 3.2.5
------------------
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/45?closed=1)
* `NodeWithCondition` was added on all nodes containing a condition.
* Lots of work on improving lexical preservation.
* If a file was parsed from a file system, you can now get path information etc. from `CompilationUnit`
* API BREAKING: every node now points to its start and end token.
Some of the API has started returning `TokenRange` instead of `Range` - you can call `toRange` to get the old object type.
We may still change the naming of some of this code in the following month.

Version 3.2.4
------------------
New style changelog, no more issue numbers, but a link: 
[issues resolved](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/milestone/44?closed=1)
and any notable changes:
* the new method `Node.removeForced()` by removing it, or removing the first parent that is optional.
This is different from `Node.remove()`, `remove()` only tries to remove the node from the parent and fails if it can't.
* `FieldAccessExpr.scope` is now a required property.
You might find some `get()`s in your code that are no longer necessary.
* `ReferenceType` no longer has a type parameter, so every `ReferenceType<?>` can be replaced by `ReferenceType` now.

Version 3.2.3
------------------
* 907 906 905 903 911 910 909 908 smaller improvements and fixes

Version 3.1.4
------------------
This is the first version to parse Java 9.

Beta: `TreeStructureVisitor`, and `LexicalPreservingPrinter`.

* 872 873 874 787 Remaining Java 9 work.

Version 3.1.3
------------------
Beta: `TreeStructureVisitor`, and `LexicalPreservingPrinter`.

A start has been made on source level support. The default level is Java 8.
It can be set to Java 9 like this for a parser *instance*:
```java
private final JavaParser parser = new JavaParser(new ParserConfiguration().setValidator(new Java9Validator()));
```
and like this for the static parse methods:
```java
JavaParser.getStaticConfiguration().setValidator(new Java9Validator());
```

* 862 552 "_" is an illegal identifier on source level 9.
* 869 867 109 855 857 smaller improvements and fixes

Version 3.1.2
------------------
Beta: `TreeStructureVisitor`, `ConcreteSyntaxModel`, and `LexicalPreservingPrinter`.

* 594 849 831 a validation framework was introduced to inform about problems in the AST without needing to change the grammar,
and without requiring parsing code.
It is open for extension by users.
* 852 853 826 832 846 839 smaller improvements and fixes

Version 3.1.1
------------------
Beta: `TreeStructureVisitor`, `ConcreteSyntaxModel`, and `LexicalPreservingPrinter`.

* 654 124 lexical preservation (printing source code with the same formatting it had when parsing) has been added.
    Thank you @ftomassetti for a lot of work! 
* 554 800 first (big) step towards Java 9 support: JavaParser can read project Jigsaw module definitions.
* 795 786 751 extend the TreeVisitor with more traversal options. Thanks @ryan-beckett!
* 791 `GenericListVisitorAdapter` has been added which collects its results in a list. Thanks @Gottox!
* 815 798 797 813 clean up Problem text
* 819 818 817 816 441 809 808 807 fix various absurd annotation related issues. 
* 777 805 802 796 790 792 793 781 784 785 783 782 779 357 799 763 smaller improvements and fixes

Version 3.1.0
------------------
Beta: `TreeStructureVisitor` and `ConcreteSyntaxModel`.

* 705 755 Add the concrete syntax model, which will give you information about the exact syntax a certain nodes matches.

* 777 smaller improvements and fixes

Version 3.1.0-beta.2
------------------
This version is a beta because `TreeStructureVisitor` is not in its definite state yet.

* 762 761 772 merge `javaparser-metamodel` and `javaparser-generator-utils` into `javaparser-core`.
* 766 the `ModifierVisitor` is now created by a code generator. Its behaviour has been made logical, and may give different results than before.
* 755 `ConstructorDeclaration` and `MethodDeclaration` now share a parent: `CallableDeclaration`
* 687 759 773 769 768 767 765 759 smaller improvements and fixes

Version 3.1.0-beta.1
------------------
This version is a beta because there are a lot of new features that may still change.

This version needs a minor version increase because of a backwards compatability issue: 
* 719 `getJavadoc`, `getJavadocComment` and `getComment` could return null. Our promise was to return `Optional`, so that is what they do now.

New:
* 658 718 736 737 we have created a metamodel.
It gives information about the structure of the various AST nodes, as if you are introspecting them.
You can find it in `javaparser-metamodel`, the main class is `JavaParserMetaModel`
* 353 365 visitors are no longer hand made, they are now generated from the metamodel. This should make them 100% reliable.
Affected visitors are: `GenericVisitorAdapter`, `EqualsVisitor`, `VoidVisitorAdapter`, `VoidVisitor`, `GenericVisitor`, `HashCodeVisitor`, `CloneVisitor`.

If you want to generate your own visitors, you can use the `VisitorGenerator` class from `javaparser-core-generators`

If you want to reuse the code generation utilities, look at module `javaparser-generator-utils` - there is a very useful `SourceRoot` class in there that takes away a lot of file management troubles.
* 538 735 `TreeStructureVisitor` has been added, which should be considered beta.
* 220 733 717 749 745 750 743 748 666 732 746 734 733 smaller improvements and fixes

------------------
* 699 433 325 Javadoc can now be parsed
* 703 696 added NodeWithOptionalScope
