This package contains a Java 1.7 Parser with AST generation and visitor support. 
The AST records the source code structure, javadoc and comments. Soon will be 
possible change the AST nodes or create new ones to modify source code like refactoring.
This parser is based on Sreenivasa Viswanadha Java 1.5 parser.

1.0.6 (2009-01-11)
- Issue 11 fixed: changed method get/setPakage to get/setPackage in the class CompilationUnit
- Created new visitor adapter to help AST modification: ModifierVisitorAdapter
- Changed visitor adapters to abstract  

1.0.5 (2008-10-26)
- Created simplified constructors in the nodes of the AST (without positional arguments) 
- Created ASTHelper class with some helpful methods (more methods are still needed)

1.0.3 (2008-09-06)
- Removed SuperMemberAccessExpr class, it was no longer used
- Removed the methods get/setTypeArgs() from ArrayCreationExpr, this node shouldn't have these methods.
