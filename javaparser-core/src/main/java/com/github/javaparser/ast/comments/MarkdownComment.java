/**
 * https://openjdk.org/jeps/467 added support for markdown JavaDoc comments
 * /// That are prefixed with ///
 * /// Support `markdown` markup and references
 * /// And supports substrings not allowed in regular block comments, e.g. *_no_space_here_/
 * <p>
 * While these comments could be seen as a series of single line comments, they are functionally block comments.
 * The {@code MarkdownComment} class adds support for this, although special handling is required for the content
 * of these comments, since the header is no longer only applied to the start of the comment, but rather to the
 * start of each line.
