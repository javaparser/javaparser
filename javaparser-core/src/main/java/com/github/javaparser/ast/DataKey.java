/**
 * A key to a piece of data associated with a {@link Node} at runtime.
 * The key contains type information that can be used to check the
 * type of any user data value for the key when the value is set. DataKey is abstract in order to
 * force the creation of a subtype. That subtype is used to test for identity when looking for the
 * user data because actual object identity would suffer from problems under serialization.
 * So, the correct way to declare a DataKey is like this:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * public static final DataKey&lt;Role&gt; ROLE = new DataKey&lt;Role&gt;() { };
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This code was taken from the <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/">Wicket project</a>.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the object which is stored
 * @see Node#getData(DataKey)
