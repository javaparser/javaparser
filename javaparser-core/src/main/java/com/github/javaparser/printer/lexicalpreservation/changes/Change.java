	 * Evaluate on derived property.
	 *
	 * Currently the evaluation of the conditions is carried out in relation to the
	 * presence of value in the field/attribute of a class referenced by a property
	 * (for example the BODY property is referenced to the body field in the
	 * LambdaExpr class) but this is not quite correct.
	 *
	 * Indeed, there are attributes that are derived. The meaning of a derived
	 * attribute (annotated with the DerivedProperty annotation) is not very clear.
	 * Assuming that it is an existing attribute and accessible by another property,
	 * for example this is the case for the EXPRESSION_BODY property which allows
	 * access to a derived field (which is also accessible by the BODY property).
	 *
	 * The 2 properties EXPRESSION_BODY and BODY have a different meaning because
	 * one references a simple expression while the other references a list of
	 * expressions (this distinction is particularly interesting in the case of
	 * lambda expressions).
	 *
	 * In this particular case, the verification of the condition defined in the
	 * syntax model used by LPP must not succeed if the nature of the property is
	 * modified. So if we modify a lamba expression composed of a single expression
	 * by replacing it with a list of expressions, the evaluation of a condition
	 * relating to the presence of the EXPRESSION_BODY property, which makes it
	 * possible to determine the nature of the change, cannot not lead to a verified
	 * proposition which could be the case if we only consider that the field
	 * referenced by the EXPRESSION_BODY property has an acceptable value before the
	 * actual modification.
	 *
	 * This is why we also check if it is a derived property whose name coincides
	 * (*) with the updated property. If this is the case, we admit that the
	 * verification of the condition must fail so that we can execute the else
	 * clause of the condition. I'm not sure this issue #3949 is completely resolved
	 * by this change.
	 *
	 * (*) Assuming that by convention the derived property is suffixed with the
	 * name of the property it derives from (e.g.. EXPRESSION_BODY which matches an
	 * expression would derive from BODY which matches a list of expressions), we
	 * could deduce that EXPRESSION_BODY and BODY actually represent the same field
	 * but the validation condition must not be checked.
