Here is some information that's good to know when contributing to JavaParser:

- if you're new and like to contribute something, check out the [easy issues](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/labels/Easy).
- we work on JavaParser because we like to, not because it earns us money. Please remember that we try to run a professional project in our spare time, on a budget of zero.
- if you know how to fix a problem, please fix it and open a pull request instead of opening an issue.
- To create a pull request, first fork javaparser, then create a branch in your fork, create the fix, push it on your branch in your fork. Then, go back to the [javaparser project site](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser) and it should have a message offering to create a pull request. (If it doesn't you can [create one manually](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/compare).)
- if you start working on an issue, please say so with a comment in the issue.
- a pull request should include tests. You can either use BDD ([more information here](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/wiki/Testing)) or JUnit.
- every pull request will automatically be checked by a few tools. Make sure AppVeyor and Travis are green.
- there is some interesting information on the [wiki](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/wiki).
- be sure to check [the coding guidelines](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/wiki/Coding-Guidelines) which are easily used by installing the formatting rules as described there.
- pull requests often stay open for at least a few days to give people a chance to review it.
- a pull request is merged when all comments on it have been resolved.
- if you create a pull request for an issue, mention the issue in the format #123 to make github link it automatically.

Thanks for helping!
